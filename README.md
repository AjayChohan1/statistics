## ðŸ“Š Objective

To determine if in-store screen advertising leads to a statistically significant and economically meaningful increase in toy sales over a 60-day period.

## ðŸ§ª Methodology

- **Data Simulation**: Simulated 60 days of toy sales with and without ads.
- **Statistical Test**: One-sided T-test using `pingouin`.
- **Visualizations**: Histograms, boxplots, and 95% confidence interval plots.
- **Economic Analysis**: Revenue calculations based on toy price and ad cost.

## ðŸ“ˆ Results Summary

- **Mean Sales Increase**: ~4.92 toys/day
- **P-value**: < 0.05 â†’ Statistically significant
- **95% Confidence Interval**: [1.81, 8.02]
- **Monthly Revenue Gain**: ~$1,476
- **Ad Cost**: $1,500
- **Net Monthly Loss**: -$24
