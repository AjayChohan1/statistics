    "  - One-sample test: Tests the difference between A and B against a known benchmark or standard.\n",

    "- Key factors:\n",
    "  - Baseline measurement (e.g., current conversion rate)\n",
    "  - Minimum Detectable Effect (MDE): smallest effect size you want to detect (e.g., 5% increase)\n",
